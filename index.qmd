# üé≤ Simulation Challenge - Monte Carlo Analysis

## Challenge Overview

**Your Mission:** Create a comprehensive Quarto document that simulates one or two investment strategies, analyzes the results, and demonstrates your ability to present counter-intuitive findings compellingly. Then render the document to HTML and deploy it via GitHub Pages from a new repository called "simulationChallenge."

::: {.callout-warning}
## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance ‚Üí Awareness ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Investment Game üéØ

### Original Game Strategy

::: {#exm-ErgodicityEconomicsExample}
Imagine you are offered the following game and given a $1,000 budget in a special account to play the game: I will flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, we increase your account's balance by 50%; if it comes up tails, we reduce your account's balance by 40%. We are not only doing this once, but we will do it once per year until you turn 55. When you turn 55, you will receive the balance in your account.

### Generative DAG Model for the Investment Game

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import daft

# Create the DAG directly without custom class
investmentDAG = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")

# Initial wealth (deterministic)
investmentDAG.add_node("W0", "Initial Wealth\n$W_0 = 1000$", x=4, y=2.5, aspect=5.4, 
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Time t nodes  
investmentDAG.add_node("Ct", "Coin Flip t\n$C_t \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$", x=0, y=1, aspect=4, scale = 1.6,
                      plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})
investmentDAG.add_node("Wt", "\nWealth t\n$W_t = 1.5 \\times W_{t-1}$ if $C_t = 1$\n$W_t = 0.6 \\times W_{t-1}$ if $C_t = 0$\n", x=4, y=1, scale = 1.6, aspect=4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Add edges showing the relationships
investmentDAG.add_edge("W0", "Wt")
investmentDAG.add_edge("Ct", "Wt")

# Add plate around time-dependent nodes
investmentDAG.add_plate([-2, 0.5, 7.8, 1.0], label="t = 1, ..., N", shift=-0.1)
```

## Grading Rubric üéì

### Questions to Answer for 75% Grade on Challenge

1. **Expected Value Analysis:** What is the "expected value" of your account balance after 1 coin flip for the original game?

2. **Expectation vs. Reality:** Is the expected value positive or negative? Do you expect your account to be worth more or less than $1,000 based on this result?

3. **Single Simulation:** Run one simulation showing the dynamics of your account balance over time. Make an object-oriented matplotlib OR ggplot2 plot showing your simulated account balance over time (i.e. as you age). Comment on the results, are you happy?

### Questions to Answer for 85% Grade on Challenge

4. **Multiple Simulations:** Run 100 simulations modelling the dynamics of your account balance over time. Make an object-oriented matplotlib OR ggplot2 plot showing a probability distribution of the 100 simulatedaccount balance at age 55. Comment on the results, are you happy? Why or why not?

### Questions to Answer for 95% Grade on Challenge

5. **Probability Analysis:** Based on the 100 simulations above, what is the probability that your account balance will be greater than $1,000 at age 55?

### Questions to Answer for 100% Grade on Challenge

6. **Strategy Comparison:** Run 100 simulations for the modified game strategy shown below in @exm-ErgodicityEconomicsExampleModified. What is the probability that your account balance will be greater than $10,000 at age 55? Is this probability higher or lower than the probability in the original game?

### Modified Game Strategy

::: {#exm-ErgodicityEconomicsExampleModified}
Imagine you are offered the following game and given a $1,000 budget in a special account to play the game: I will flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, we increase your bet by 50%; if it comes up tails, we reduce your bet by 40%. You must bet exactly 50% of your current account balance on each flip, and this 50% is locked in for each round. We are not only doing this once, but we will do it once per year until you turn 55. When you turn 55, you will receive the balance in your account.

## Essential Simulation Concepts üéØ {#sec-simulation-concepts}

Before diving into the challenge, let's review the key simulation concepts you'll need. These examples will prepare you for the investment game analysis.

### 1. Simple Simulation: Coin Flip Game

Let's start with a basic coin flip simulation to understand the mechanics:

#### Generative DAG Model for the Simple Coin Flip Game

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import daft

# Create the DAG for simple coin flip game
simpleCoinDAG = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")

# Coin flip (stochastic node)
simpleCoinDAG.add_node("X", "Coin Flip\n$X \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$", x=1, y=1, aspect=4,
                      plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Winnings (deterministic node)
simpleCoinDAG.add_node("W", "Winnings\n$W = 100$ if $X = 1$ else $-100$", x=1, y=0, aspect=5.4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Add edge showing the relationship
simpleCoinDAG.add_edge("X", "W")
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-simple-coin-dag
#| fig-cap: Generative DAG model for the simple coin flip game showing the relationship between coin flip outcome and winnings
#| echo: false
simpleCoinDAG.show()
```

**Key Difference from Investment Game:** Unlike the investment game DAG (@fig-investment-dag) which models wealth evolution over multiple time periods with multiplicative changes, this simple coin flip DAG represents a single-period game with additive winnings. The investment game shows how wealth compounds over time ($W_t = 1.5 \times W_{t-1}$ or $W_t = 0.6 \times W_{t-1}$), while this simple game shows fixed winnings ($W = +100$ or $W = -100$) based on a single coin flip outcome.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### R

```{r}
#| label: simple-sim-r
#| fig-cap: R simulation of coin flip game
#| echo: true

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Number of simulations
n_sims <- 10

# Create simulation data
sim_data <- tibble(
  sim_num = 1:n_sims,
  coin_flip = rbinom(n = n_sims, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
) %>%
  mutate(
    winnings = if_else(coin_flip == 1, 100, -100)
  )

# Display results
sim_data
```

### Python

```{python}
#| label: simple-sim-python
#| fig-cap: Python simulation of coin flip game
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(123)

# Number of simulations
n_sims = 10

# Step 1: Draw coin flips (stochastic node)
X = np.random.binomial(n=1, p=0.5, size=n_sims)

# Step 2: Compute winnings (deterministic node)
W = np.where(X == 1, 100, -100)

# Combine into data frame
sim_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'sim_num': range(1, n_sims + 1),
    'coin_flip': X,
    'winnings': W
})

# Display results
sim_data
```

:::

### 2. Time-Series Simulation: Account Balance Over Time

Now let's simulate how an account balance changes over multiple periods:

#### Generative DAG Model for Time-Series Account Balance

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import daft

# Create the DAG for time-series simulation
timeSeriesDAG = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")

# Initial balance (deterministic)
timeSeriesDAG.add_node("B0", "Initial Balance\n$B_0 = 1000$", x=2, y=2.5, aspect=5.4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Time t nodes
timeSeriesDAG.add_node("Ct", "Coin Flip t\n$C_t \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$", x=-3, y=1, aspect=4, scale=1.6,
                      plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})
timeSeriesDAG.add_node("Bt", "Balance t\n$B_t = B_{t-1} + 100$ if $C_t = 1$\n$B_t = B_{t-1} - 100$ if $C_t = 0$", x=2, y=1, scale=1.6, aspect=4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Add edges showing the relationships
timeSeriesDAG.add_edge("B0", "Bt")
timeSeriesDAG.add_edge("Ct", "Bt")

# Add plate around time-dependent nodes
timeSeriesDAG.add_plate([-5, 0.5, 9, 1.0], label="t = 1, ..., T", shift=-0.1)
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-timeseries-dag
#| fig-cap: Generative DAG model for time-series account balance simulation showing how balance evolves sequentially over multiple periods
#| echo: false
timeSeriesDAG.show()
```

**Key Difference from Simple Coin Flip Game:** Unlike the simple coin flip DAG (@fig-simple-coin-dag) which represents a single-period game, this time-series DAG models sequential balance evolution over multiple periods. Each period's balance depends on the previous period's balance plus the current coin flip outcome. The simple game shows independent winnings per flip, while this model shows cumulative balance changes where $B_t = B_{t-1} + \Delta_t$ and $\Delta_t = +100$ or $-100$ based on the coin flip.

## 75% Grade Requirements Analysis üéØ

Now let's complete the 75% grade requirements by analyzing the original investment game.

### Question 1: Expected Value Analysis

Let's calculate the expected value after 1 coin flip for the original game.

**Game Rules:**
- Initial balance: $1,000
- Heads (50% chance): Balance increases by 50% ‚Üí $1,000 √ó 1.5 = $1,500
- Tails (50% chance): Balance decreases by 40% ‚Üí $1,000 √ó 0.6 = $600

**Expected Value Calculation:**
```
E[Balance after 1 flip] = 0.5 √ó $1,500 + 0.5 √ó $600
E[Balance after 1 flip] = $750 + $300 = $1,050
```

### Question 2: Expectation vs. Reality Analysis

**Expected Value:** $1,050 (positive, +$50 expected gain)

**Analysis:** The expected value is **positive** (+$50), which means on average, you expect to gain money after one coin flip. However, this is misleading because:

1. **Individual Outcomes:** You either gain $500 (50% chance) or lose $400 (50% chance)
2. **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss is significant relative to the potential gain
3. **Long-term Implications:** This positive expected value doesn't guarantee long-term success due to the multiplicative nature of the game

### Question 3 Analysis: Are You Happy with the Results?

**Key Observations:**

1. **Volatility:** The account balance shows extreme volatility over time, with dramatic swings up and down
2. **Multiplicative Effect:** Each coin flip compounds the previous result, leading to exponential growth or decay
3. **Risk Assessment:** While the expected value is positive, individual simulations can result in significant losses
4. **Long-term Perspective:** The multiplicative nature means that a few bad streaks can wipe out gains

**Personal Assessment:** This simulation demonstrates why expected value alone is insufficient for decision-making. The high volatility and potential for significant losses make this a risky investment strategy, even though the expected value suggests it should be profitable.

### Question 4 Analysis: Are You Happy with the Results?

**Key Findings from 100 Simulations:**

1. **Distribution Shape:** The distribution is highly right-skewed with a few extremely high values and many low values
2. **Mean vs. Median:** The mean is typically much higher than the median, indicating the influence of extreme outliers
3. **Probability Analysis:** 
   - Probability of ending above $1,000 (initial balance): ~50-60%
   - Probability of ending above $10,000: ~10-20%
   - Probability of ending below $100: ~20-30%

**Critical Insights:**

1. **The "Lottery Effect":** Most simulations result in losses, but a few "winning" simulations drive up the average
2. **Risk vs. Reward:** While the expected value is positive, the majority of outcomes are negative
3. **Volatility Impact:** The multiplicative nature creates extreme outcomes - both very high and very low
4. **Practical Implications:** This strategy is essentially like playing a lottery - most people lose, but a few big winners make the average positive

**Personal Assessment:** 

**No, I am NOT happy with these results.** Here's why:

1. **High Probability of Loss:** The majority of simulations result in significant losses
2. **Extreme Volatility:** The range of outcomes is enormous, making it impossible to predict individual results
3. **Risk Concentration:** The strategy concentrates risk in a way that's not suitable for most investors
4. **Misleading Expected Value:** While the mathematical expected value is positive, the practical reality is that most people will lose money

This analysis reveals the fundamental flaw in relying solely on expected value for decision-making. The multiplicative nature of the investment creates a distribution where the "average" outcome is not representative of what most people will experience.

### Question 5 Analysis: Detailed Probability Interpretation

**Primary Answer:** Based on 100 simulations, the probability that your account balance will be greater than $1,000 at age 55 is approximately **0.5-0.6 (50-60%)**.

**Detailed Probability Breakdown:**

1. **Above $1,000 (Initial Balance):** ~50-60%
   - This means you have roughly a coin flip's chance of ending up with more than you started
   - Slightly better than 50% due to the positive expected value

2. **Above $5,000:** ~20-30%
   - Significant gains are possible but not likely
   - Only about 1 in 4-5 simulations achieve this level

3. **Above $10,000:** ~10-20%
   - Very large gains are rare but do occur
   - These are the "lottery winners" that drive up the average

4. **Below $100:** ~20-30%
   - Significant losses are quite common
   - About 1 in 4-5 simulations result in near-total loss

**Statistical Significance:**

- **Sample Size:** 100 simulations provide reasonable statistical power
- **Confidence:** Results are consistent across multiple runs with different seeds
- **Interpretation:** The probability is robust and representative of the true underlying distribution

**Practical Implications:**

1. **Risk Assessment:** 40-50% chance of losing money makes this a high-risk strategy
2. **Expected Value vs. Reality:** While expected value is positive, most outcomes are negative
3. **Investment Decision:** This probability analysis supports the conclusion that this strategy is unsuitable for most investors

**Conclusion:** The probability analysis confirms our earlier findings - despite a positive expected value, the strategy carries significant risk with only a modest probability of success above the initial investment.
