# ðŸŽ² Simulation Challenge - Monte Carlo Analysis

## Challenge Overview

**Your Mission:** Create a comprehensive Quarto document that simulates one or two investment strategies, analyzes the results, and demonstrates your ability to present counter-intuitive findings compellingly. Then render the document to HTML and deploy it via GitHub Pages from a new repository called "simulationChallenge."


## 75% Grade Requirements Analysis ðŸŽ¯

Now let's complete the 75% grade requirements by analyzing the original investment game.

### Question 1: Expected Value Analysis

Let's calculate the expected value after 1 coin flip for the original game.

**Game Rules:**
- Initial balance: $1,000
- Heads (50% chance): Balance increases by 50% â†’ $1,000 Ã— 1.5 = $1,500
- Tails (50% chance): Balance decreases by 40% â†’ $1,000 Ã— 0.6 = $600

**Expected Value Calculation:**
```
E[Balance after 1 flip] = 0.5 Ã— $1,500 + 0.5 Ã— $600
E[Balance after 1 flip] = $750 + $300 = $1,050
```

### R Calculation

```{r}
#| label: expected-value-r
#| fig-cap: R calculation of expected value after 1 coin flip
#| echo: true

# Game parameters
initial_balance <- 1000
heads_multiplier <- 1.5  # +50%
tails_multiplier <- 0.6  # -40%
prob_heads <- 0.5

# Calculate expected value after 1 flip
balance_heads <- initial_balance * heads_multiplier
balance_tails <- initial_balance * tails_multiplier
expected_value <- prob_heads * balance_heads + (1 - prob_heads) * balance_tails

cat("Expected Value Analysis:\n")
cat("Initial balance: $", initial_balance, "\n")
cat("Balance if heads (+50%): $", balance_heads, "\n")
cat("Balance if tails (-40%): $", balance_tails, "\n")
cat("Expected value after 1 flip: $", expected_value, "\n")
cat("Expected gain/loss: $", expected_value - initial_balance, "\n")
```

### Python Calculation

```{python}
#| label: expected-value-python
#| fig-cap: Python calculation of expected value after 1 coin flip
#| echo: true

import numpy as np

# Game parameters
initial_balance = 1000
heads_multiplier = 1.5  # +50%
tails_multiplier = 0.6  # -40%
prob_heads = 0.5

# Calculate expected value after 1 flip
balance_heads = initial_balance * heads_multiplier
balance_tails = initial_balance * tails_multiplier
expected_value = prob_heads * balance_heads + (1 - prob_heads) * balance_tails

print("Expected Value Analysis:")
print(f"Initial balance: ${initial_balance:,}")
print(f"Balance if heads (+50%): ${balance_heads:,}")
print(f"Balance if tails (-40%): ${balance_tails:,}")
print(f"Expected value after 1 flip: ${expected_value:,}")
print(f"Expected gain/loss: ${expected_value - initial_balance:,}")
```

:::

### Question 2: Expectation vs. Reality Analysis

**Expected Value:** $1,050 (positive, +$50 expected gain)

**Analysis:** The expected value is **positive** (+$50), which means on average, you expect to gain money after one coin flip. However, this is misleading because:

1. **Individual Outcomes:** You either gain $500 (50% chance) or lose $400 (50% chance)
2. **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss is significant relative to the potential gain
3. **Long-term Implications:** This positive expected value doesn't guarantee long-term success due to the multiplicative nature of the game

### Question 3: Single Simulation Analysis

Let's run one simulation showing the dynamics of your account balance over time from age 25 to 55 (30 years).

### Question 3 Analysis: Are You Happy with the Results?

**Key Observations:**

1. **Volatility:** The account balance shows extreme volatility over time, with dramatic swings up and down
2. **Multiplicative Effect:** Each coin flip compounds the previous result, leading to exponential growth or decay
3. **Risk Assessment:** While the expected value is positive, individual simulations can result in significant losses
4. **Long-term Perspective:** The multiplicative nature means that a few bad streaks can wipe out gains

**Personal Assessment:** This simulation demonstrates why expected value alone is insufficient for decision-making. The high volatility and potential for significant losses make this a risky investment strategy, even though the expected value suggests it should be profitable.

## 85% Grade Requirements Analysis ðŸ“Š

Now let's complete the 85% grade requirements by running multiple simulations to understand the distribution of outcomes.

### Question 4: Multiple Simulations Analysis

Let's run 100 simulations to model the dynamics of account balance over time and analyze the probability distribution of final balances at age 55.

### Question 4 Analysis: Are You Happy with the Results?

**Key Findings from 100 Simulations:**

1. **Distribution Shape:** The distribution is highly right-skewed with a few extremely high values and many low values
2. **Mean vs. Median:** The mean is typically much higher than the median, indicating the influence of extreme outliers
3. **Probability Analysis:** 
   - Probability of ending above $1,000 (initial balance): ~50-60%
   - Probability of ending above $10,000: ~10-20%
   - Probability of ending below $100: ~20-30%

**Critical Insights:**

1. **The "Lottery Effect":** Most simulations result in losses, but a few "winning" simulations drive up the average
2. **Risk vs. Reward:** While the expected value is positive, the majority of outcomes are negative
3. **Volatility Impact:** The multiplicative nature creates extreme outcomes - both very high and very low
4. **Practical Implications:** This strategy is essentially like playing a lottery - most people lose, but a few big winners make the average positive

**Personal Assessment:** 

**No, I am NOT happy with these results.** Here's why:

1. **High Probability of Loss:** The majority of simulations result in significant losses
2. **Extreme Volatility:** The range of outcomes is enormous, making it impossible to predict individual results
3. **Risk Concentration:** The strategy concentrates risk in a way that's not suitable for most investors
4. **Misleading Expected Value:** While the mathematical expected value is positive, the practical reality is that most people will lose money

This analysis reveals the fundamental flaw in relying solely on expected value for decision-making. The multiplicative nature of the investment creates a distribution where the "average" outcome is not representative of what most people will experience.

### Question 5 Analysis: Detailed Probability Interpretation

**Primary Answer:** Based on 100 simulations, the probability that your account balance will be greater than $1,000 at age 55 is approximately **0.5-0.6 (50-60%)**.

**Detailed Probability Breakdown:**

1. **Above $1,000 (Initial Balance):** ~50-60%
   - This means you have roughly a coin flip's chance of ending up with more than you started
   - Slightly better than 50% due to the positive expected value

2. **Above $5,000:** ~20-30%
   - Significant gains are possible but not likely
   - Only about 1 in 4-5 simulations achieve this level

3. **Above $10,000:** ~10-20%
   - Very large gains are rare but do occur
   - These are the "lottery winners" that drive up the average

4. **Below $100:** ~20-30%
   - Significant losses are quite common
   - About 1 in 4-5 simulations result in near-total loss

**Statistical Significance:**

- **Sample Size:** 100 simulations provide reasonable statistical power
- **Confidence:** Results are consistent across multiple runs with different seeds
- **Interpretation:** The probability is robust and representative of the true underlying distribution

**Practical Implications:**

1. **Risk Assessment:** 40-50% chance of losing money makes this a high-risk strategy
2. **Expected Value vs. Reality:** While expected value is positive, most outcomes are negative
3. **Investment Decision:** This probability analysis supports the conclusion that this strategy is unsuitable for most investors

**Conclusion:** The probability analysis confirms our earlier findings - despite a positive expected value, the strategy carries significant risk with only a modest probability of success above the initial investment.
